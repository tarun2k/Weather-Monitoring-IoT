<h1>IoT based Weather Monitoring System </h1>

An IOT project using embedded systems to make the sensor values available globally using Google Sheets.

<b>The following are the requirements for this project:</b>

<b> Software Requirements: </b>

1.) Arduino IDE

<b> Hardware Requirements: </b>

1.)	 Arduino Uno 

2.)	 Wifi Module (ESP8266)

3.)	 Humidity and Temperature sensor (DHT11)

4.)	 Solar Cell, 5V 

5.)	 Breadboard 

6.)	 Jumper Wires

7.)	 CO sensor (MQ7 and MQ9)

8.)	 DC Step down converter LM2596

<b> Deploying and Testing </b>


1.) <b> Programming Arduino UNO </b>

-> Connect the board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED (labelled PWR) should go on.

-> In tools, select the board as Arduino UNO on Arduino IDE, if not selected automatically and select the port.

-> Open the Arduino program attached above in the Arduino IDE.

-> Now, simply click the "Upload" button in the environment. Wait a few seconds - you should see the RX and TX leds on the board flashing. If the upload is successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar.


2.) <b> Programming Wifi Module ESP8266 </b>
